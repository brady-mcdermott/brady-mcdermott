# Welcome!
</br>

### Since we haven't officially met yet, here's a little **About Me**
</br>

I'm a senior at Penn State, majoring in Computer Science, with a passion for shaping the future of tech. Recently, I've interned, and am now working part time, at Vision Solutions AR, where I've been immersed in AR development using a suite of modern technologies. Last year, I was a CERT Workforce Development Intern at Carnegie Mellon University, developing complex challenge scenarios and enhancing cybersecurity skills. Passionate about software engineering, cybersecurity, and AR, I'm eager to contribute to innovative technology solutions.
